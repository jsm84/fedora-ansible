## TODO List
I've made alot of progress, but the following are still todo items.

* Install the oc tool into /usr/local/bin
* Setup oc-completion for the oc command
* Perhaps add `$GOPATH` and Operator SDK setup, but this must be done as the current user and not root
* Possibly adapt this Playbook for usage with RHEL 7 or (even better) the upcoming RHEL 8.
