# This playbook installs optional, non-work related extras intended for off-hours use only :)
# Don't use the "become" flag with this playbook, or your user account won't get added to the plugdev (openrazer) or pkg-build (spotify) groups.
# Set the variables below according to preference, but Steam and Wine are always installed.
#
# To run locally, define "localhost ansible_connection=local" in your hosts inventory and run:
# ansible-playbook -K -i hosts playbooks/extras.yml
#
# To run remotely, define your remote machines in your hosts inventory and run:
# ansible-playbook -kKu <username> -i hosts playbooks/extras.yml
#
# See roles/extras/defaults/main.yml for a list of all supported variables
